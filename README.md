# Hacker News
This is a dummy React-Native app, where a user can see a list of top stories, comments made on a story and redirects to an original story.

## Experience
This application was built as an assignment, it was a simple app and could have been made simply but for practice purposes and to demonstrate my skills, I decided to implement the following:

- Redux
- Redux-saga
- Axios
- React-navigation
- Custom hooks
- Custom components
- Typescript etc.
